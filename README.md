Q: Do we have to annotate waveforms for all testbenches?
    
A: Simple text outputs from testbenches are fine where applicable. The point of testbench "annotations" is to show the TAs that you've thoroughly tested the intended behavior of the module. So long as you demonstrate this, you should be fine.
